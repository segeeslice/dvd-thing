# DVD... Thing

**Current version:** v0.1.1

A small pet project of mine to create a familiar [bouncing DVD
logo](https://bouncingdvdlogo.com) with some extra twists.

See TODO.md if you're curious about the upcoming features.

I hope to use the skills I build here to develop an action platformer or
isometric ARPG in the future. Hopefully the link to that project will be
[here](https://youtu.be/xc917wPX1x8) one day. But for now, it's just Mr.
Bubz.

## Usage (dev)
- Download [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org), a Lua-based 2D game engine
- To run: `love src/` or `./run.sh` from the base directory
- To build: `./build.sh` (although not really supported yet..)
